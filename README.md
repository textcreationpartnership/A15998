    _ CHAPTER. 1. The beginning and the ende of the ſeauentie yeeres captiuitie.

    _ CHAP. 2. The ſtate of the Hebrewes, vntill the birth of our Lord, vnder the Caldeans, Medes-Perſians, and the Graecians: The kingdome of Chriſte ſhall after that fill the whole earth. Daniel is a new Ioſeph.

    _ CHAP. 3. The king hauing dreamed of the Image, ſoone after maketh an Image of golde, wherein th• idolatrie of Babel is confuted by Daniels aduanced felowes, the angell of God accompanying them in the fyer: and the king by decree confirming the honour of their God.

    _ CHAP. 4. The Golden bead imputeth his victories, not to the God of heauen, but to himſelfe, and his God, vntill he had been madd ſeauen yeeres: then he proclaymeth Gods power ouer all the worlde.

The idolatrie of Madaj and Paras, in making their Kinges Goddes, with brutiſh penaltie vpon the contemners: confuted by Daniel, and iudged by the Lyons, euen vnto a publique imperiall honour by decree for Daniels God. The Chaldy wherein this Chapter is written by Daniel, is mixt with Arabique: which tongue the Perſians here ſeeme to haue much vſed.

    _ CHAP. 7. The Kingdomes which were ſhowed for the capacitie of Nebuchadnezar in a goodly Image, are now agayne ſhewed, aboue 60. yeeres after the other, to the prophet Daniel him ſelfe, in the formes of foure Beaſtes. And whereas their worldly deſtruction, was likened to chaffe caried away by the winde: now their eternal puniſhment is expreſſed by fire. And the Stone afore cut from the Mountayne, is here the Sonne of Man, honored with the throne of the eternall Father.

      * Cloſe phraſes, vſed in chap. 8.

      * CHAP. 8.

    _ CHAP. 9. At the ende of the 70. yeeres captiuitie, Daniel praying for returne, is tolde that the deliuerie to Ieruſalem is preſently graunted him: and the eternall, by our Lordes death is ſhewed: that it ſhalbe at ſeuen times ſeuentie Y. from the houre of his prayer. So long Ieruſalem ſhall haue the prerogatiue to be the holy Citie. But then the Heathen ſhalbe equal in the couenant, and al Moſes ceremonies muſt ceaſe. For enforcement to beholde that, Chriſt will deſtroy the Citie and Holy place, in the age folowyng. His prayer is penned with ſpeciall regarde, euen of the very Ebrew ſyllables to the prophets, from whom the matter of his ſpeach is taken. Thoſe places muſt be marked.

      * Of the 70. ſeuens.

      * How the 70. ſeuens end the holy Chronicle.

      * How the Chaine of Iubilees attendeth vpon this.

      * Of Daniels People.

      * An expoſition of the former Law phraſes: by the common termes of men.

      * A reduction of the Goſpell vnto the oration of Gabriel.

      * The certaintie of the Ebrew. 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

    _ CHAP. 10. Daniel hath one viſion deſcribing Chriſt the moſt holy: and an other of an Angel: who ſheweth vnto him in generall, the affayres of the Iewes diſtreſſe vnder the Perſians: And how the Perſians are ruled by this Angel, vntil the king of Iauan, Alexander the great commeth.

    _ CHAP. 11. Gabriel geueth now an expoſition of the matters figured by the Image: great, goodly, and tirrible: by the beaſtes that came out of the Sea: and by the other that battered at the riuer Vlai, in more particuler ſort, then the former three expoſitions of thoſe three viſions ſhewed the matter: ſo that this is the ſeauenth time, that the ſame nations are ſpoken off: thrife figured, and as often expounded afore. This ſpeach teacheth of their particular dealinges, in ſuch playnnes, as the Heathen afterwardes penned their doinges. He reckoneth how many kinges of Perſia ſhalbe ſoone cut off, or ouerthrowen, for hindering the worke of the Temple. Thence, he paſſeth ouer to great Alexander, and geueth an abridgement of all his ſtories: his ariſing, his fall, and his houſes: of his foure principall ſucceſſours, of the many others leſser then they, of two the mightieſt: whoſe families ſhould all their time, both, clayme the kingdome of Iudah: And he geueth an hiſtorie aforehand of ten Kinges, the ten hornes of the fourth Beaſt: ſhewing in them the rigour of the iron legges, and iron teeth: how not only they deuoured Iudah in their taxes, and other yeerely reuenues, but trode it more downe, by their continuall camping in it, from both their chiefe kingdomes. And in Antiochus Epiphanes, the laſt inſtrument of wrath againſt the Holy couenant; he continueth a long ſpeach, as he was chiefly to be looked vnto: of his treacherous comming vp in Syria, by poyſoning his brother: of his preparing againſt Egypt (where by the way Iudah felt the beginning of the 2300. dayes oppreſſion:) of his great ſucceſſe in his firſt voyage into Egypt: of the ſeconde, with bad ſucceſſe: and his vehementer rage againſt the Temple, by his returne through Iudea: which rage helde three yeeres and an halfe: of a thirde voyage, wherein he ſpoyled Egypt exceedingly, and returned through Iudea to Elymais: and of his death by the hand of God. All theſe thinges are

handled of him ſo particularly, that all the wyſe of thoſe dayes might be confirmed to ſtande to the trueth, ſeeing aforehand what ſhould be their euent: and all of all ages marke in whom the laſt viſions of Daniel ended, that the prophecies might draw men vnto Chriſt: and not beyonde him, as the Iewes now adayes woulde peruert his ſayinges, and turne them in moſt ſenſeleſse wyſe againſt Chriſtianitie, and to their owne eternall ruine. For all this, Heathen ſtories are for vs ſure witneſses, of the Angels meaning.

      * A repetition of Babels fall.

      * ¶ Of 4. Perſian kinges, plagued for the Temple.

      * ❧ Of Alexander, and his family.

      * ¶ Of the two legges, ioyned to the belly and ſides. cha. 2. the two kingdomes which remayned of Alexanders Princes: which make the fourth beaſt with ten hornes.

      * Of the mixture of Iron and Clay, how the two parted Kingdome, the two legges; Dan. 2. ioyned in mans ſeede, and Mariages, cleaueth together as Iron and Clay: a daughter of the South king being giuen to the Northren.

      * How Heathen that neuer knew Daniel recorde the euent of this matter.

      * Of Antiochus ſurnamed the Great .6. horne.

      * Of the great Armies of Antiochus and Ptolemy Philopator.

      * Of Ptolemy Philopator, and his Armie gotten to be great, againſt Antiochus the great: after which victorie he is a ſeauenth Horne to Iudah.

      * The death of Antiochus the great.

      * Of Seleuc. Philopator, the 9. Horne.

      * Of Antiochus Epiphanes the 10. horne, in whom the iron of the Syriaque legge doth end, and on whom the reſt of Daniel goeth: how he is a litle horne, a plucker away of three before him: of his Seleueus Philopater loued his fathers ſteps of Church-robbing. Iaſon of Cyren abridged by him which wrote the ſecond of the Machabees, ſheweth how Seleucus would haue robbed the Temple of Ieruſalem. Although that booke is full of Rabbique trickes, and hath ſome openly Talmudicall, as making Nehemias to be all one with Zorobabel, the builder of Altar and Temple, as the Babylonian Talmud doth in Sanedrin, & hath many childiſh flouriſhes, yet as we vſe heathen euen fables for ſubſtance of a narration, though couered with light ſtuffe: we may cite that author for ſo much: hearing from God by heathen what Seleucus would be. His poyſoning is here deſcribed: a breaking, not by face to face, not by warres. So cloſe guile, as poyſoning muſt be the third kind. Appian in Syriaques ſheweth all: thus, When Antiochus the Great was dead, Seleucus his ſonne ſucceeded. And he did ſet free his brother Antiochus from the Romanes hoſtage, yeelding his ſonne Demetrius in lieu of him. Now when Antiochus returned from hoſtage, and was about Athens, Seleucus dyeth by the trecherie of one Heliodorus that was about him. That Heliodorus vſurped the reigne: but Eumenes and Attalus remoue him: and ſettle Antiochus in it, winning that mans fauour: being now vpon offences in ſuſpition of the Romanes. And ſo Antiochus the ſonne of Antiochus the great obteined the reigne of Syria. He had his ſyrname Epiphanes, becauſe the kingdome being catched at by others, he cometh to be ſeene their king. Mark how the Angel touched all theſe matters and moe.brother (by Heliodorus ſleight, though he after would haue raigned,) of his brothers ſonne, and of his ſiſter Cleopatras ſonne: and how he had eyes like a priuate man: and a mouth ſpeaking preſumptuous things.

      * The dealings of Antiochus Epiphanes touching Ptolemie Philometor and Iudah: whence the troubles of Iuda. 1. Mach. begin.

      * The dealing of Antiochus againſt Iudaea.

      * Antiochus his third voyage into Egypt: againſt Ptolemie Philometor.

      * How Antiochus beſtowed the ſpoiles of Aegypt and of other countreys, as Polybius in Atheneus recordeth, as a witneſſe vnto the holy Angell.

      * Of Antiochus Parthian war and breaking without hand, chap. 8. and casting into the fier, chap. 7.

    _ CHAP. 12. A further explication of the afflictions vnder Antiochus Epiphanes: and notes vpon the vvhole oration.

      * The better reſurrection and the worſe: Eb. 11. to life, and to Iudgement, Iohn. 5.

      * Of keeping cloſe theſe Prophecies.

      * The 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 and hiding of the minde, which Daniel vſed.

      * An Angel demaundes how long the wonders of Antiochus dealings shall preuaile: and hath an anſwere from chap. 7.25. that it ſhall continue three yeares and an halfe. And thereupon the Greekes hand ſet vpon the holy people ſhalbe bruſed.

      * Daniels demaundes concerning the time when the Iewes should begin to recouer their ſtate from the Greekes: with ſpeeches of Chriſt touching the darkneſſe of all the oration, and counſel for the afflictions of the godly.

1. The Concluſion.
